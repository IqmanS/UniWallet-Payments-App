**Idea #1**

We already know how wallet and UPI payment are too quick and hassle free that many time we forget when we spend so much money so just like how phone has a low battery change of color in alert system we tried to change theme of the app on the basis of the balance one has over the month. 


 - Let us say at the start of month you have â‚¹5000 in your bank as your avg balance.<br>

</div>

 - Then two weeks later you spent â‚¹4200 and only have â‚¹800 as balance left which is low so your app theme will shift to red indicating you have low balance and that you should check your balance.<br>

</div>
  
 - Now after the alert you controlled your budget and by end of month you again got money and now your balance has reached â‚¹6000 which is more than your average amount so your theme will again change to Green.<br>
